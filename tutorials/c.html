<h1 id="toc_0">Getting started with libmapper</h1>

<p>Since <em>libmapper</em> uses GNU autoconf, getting started with the library is the same as any other library on Linux; use <code>./configure</code> and then <code>make</code> to compile it.
On Mac OS X, we provide a precompiled Framework bundle for 32- and 64-bit Intel platforms, so using it with XCode should be a matter of including it in your project.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Overview of the API structure</h2>

<p>If you take a look at the <a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/index.html">API documentation</a>, there is a section called &quot;modules&quot;.
This is divided into the following main sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/group__graphs.html">Graphs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/group__objects.html">Objects</a>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/group__devices.html">Devices</a></li>
<li><a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/group__signals.html">Signals</a> and <a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/group__instances.html">Signal Instances</a></li>
<li><a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/group__maps.html">Maps</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://libmapper.github.io/api/group__lists.html">Lists</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For this tutorial, the only sections to pay attention to are <strong>Devices</strong> and <strong>Signals</strong>.
The other sections are mostly used when building user interfaces for
designing mapping configurations.
Functions and types from each module are prefixed with <code>mpr_&lt;module&gt;_</code>, in order to avoid namespace clashing.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Devices</h2>

<h3 id="toc_3">Creating a device</h3>

<p>To create a <em>libmapper</em> device, it is necessary to provide two arguments to the function <code>mpr_dev_new</code>:</p>

<pre>mpr_dev mpr_dev_new(const char *name_prefix, mpr_graph graph);</pre>

<p>Every device on the network needs a descriptive name – the name does not have to be unique since during initialization a unique ordinal will be appended to the device name.
This allows multiple devices with the same name to exist on the network.</p>

<p>The second argument is an optional graph instance.
It is not necessary to provide this, but can be used to specify different networking parameters, such as specifying the name of the network interface to use.
For this tutorial we will let libmapper choose a default interface.</p>

<p>An example of creating a device:</p>

<pre>mpr_dev my_dev = mpr_dev_new(&quot;test&quot;, 0);</pre>

<h3 id="toc_4">Polling the device</h3>

<p>The device lifecycle looks like this:</p>

<p><img style="display:block;margin:auto;padding:0px;width:75%" src="./images/device_lifecycle.png"></p>

<p>In other words, after a device is created, it must be continuously polled during its lifetime, and then explicitly freed when it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>The polling is necessary for several reasons: to respond to requests on the admin bus; to check for incoming signals; to update outgoing signals.
Therefore even a device that does not have signals must be polled.
The user program must organize to have a timer or idle handler which can poll the device often enough.
Polling interval is not extremely sensitive, but should be 100 ms or less.
The faster it is polled, the faster it can handle incoming and outgoing signals.</p>

<p>The <code>mpr_dev_poll</code> function can be blocking or non-blocking, depending on how you want your application to behave.
It takes a number of milliseconds during which it should do some work, or 0 if it should check for any immediate actions and then return without waiting:</p>

<pre>int mpr_dev_poll(mpr_dev dev, int block_ms);</pre>

<p>An example of calling it with non-blocking behaviour:</p>

<pre>mpr_dev_poll(my_dev, 0);</pre>

<p>If your polling is in the middle of a processing function or in response to a GUI event for example, non-blocking behaviour is desired.
On the other hand if you put it in the middle of a loop which reads incoming data at intervals or steps through a simulation for example, you can use <code>mpr_dev_poll</code> as your &quot;sleep&quot; function, so that it will react to network activity while waiting.</p>

<p>It returns the number of messages handled, so optionally you could continue to call it until there are no more messages waiting.
The same effect can be acheived by passing a negative value for the <code>block_ms</code> argument.
Of course, you should be careful doing that without limiting the time it will loop for, since if the incoming stream is fast enough you might never get anything else done!</p>

<p>Note that an important difference between blocking and non-blocking polling is that during the blocking period, messages will be handled immediately as they are received.
On the other hand, if you use your own sleep, messages will be
queued up until you can call poll(); stated differently, it will &quot;time-quantize&quot; the message handling.
This is not necessarily bad, but you should be aware of this effect.</p>

<p>If your code has updated signal values and will not be calling <code>poll()</code> immediately, you may wish to call the function <code>update_maps()</code>.
This will immediately cause any outgoing maps to be processed and send their updates to the destination signal.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Initialization</h3>

<p>Since there is a delay before the device is completely initialized, it is sometimes useful to be able to determine this using <code>mpr_dev_ready</code>.
Only when <code>mpr_dev_ready</code> returns non-zero is it valid to use the device&#39;s name.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Freeing the device</h3>

<p>It is necessary to explicitly free the device at the end of your program.
This not only frees memory, but also sends some messages to &quot;politely&quot; remove itself from the network.</p>

<p>An example of freeing a device:</p>

<pre>mpr_dev_free(my_dev);</pre>

<h2 id="toc_7">Signals</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to create a device, poll it, and free it, we only need to know how to add signals in order to give our program some input/output functionality.
While <em>libmapper</em> enables arbitrary connections between <em>any</em> declared signals, we still find it helpful to distinguish between two type of
signals: <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>outputs</code> signals are <em>sources</em> of data, updated locally by their parent device</li>
<li><code>inputs</code> signals are <em>consumers</em> of data and are <strong>not</strong> generally updated locally by their parent device.</li>
</ul>

<p>This can become a bit confusing, since the &quot;reverb&quot; parameter of a sound synthesizer might be updated locally through user interaction with a GUI, however the normal use of this signal is as a <em>destination</em> for control data streams so it should be defined as an <code>input</code> signal.
Note that this distinction is to help with GUI organization and user-understanding – <em>libmapper</em> enables connections from input signals and to output signals if
desired.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">Creating a signal</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll start with creating a &quot;sender&quot;, so we will first talk about how to update output signals.
A signal requires a bit more information than a device, much of which is optional:</p>

<pre>mpr_sig mpr_sig_new(mpr_dev parent, mpr_dir dir, const char *name, int length,
                    mpr_type type, const char *unit, void *min, void *max,
                    int *num_inst, mpr_sig_handler *h, int events);</pre>

<p>The only <em>required</em> parameters here are the signal direction, name, vector length and data type.
Signals are assumed to be vectors of values, so for usual single-valued signals, a length of 1 should be specified.
Finally, supported types are currently <code>MPR_INT32</code>, <code>MPR_FLT</code>, or <code>MPR_DBL</code> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types">integer, float, and double</a> values, respectively.</p>

<p>The other parameters are not strictly required, but the more information you provide, the more <em>libmapper</em> can do some things automatically.
For example, if <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> are provided, it will be possible to create linear-scaled connections very quickly.
If <code>unit</code> is provided, <em>libmapper</em> will be able to similarly figure out a linear scaling based on unit conversion (from cm to inches for example).
Currently automatic unit-based scaling is not a supported feature, but will be added in the future.
You can take advantage of this future development by simply providing unit information whenever it is available.
It is also helpful documentation for users.</p>

<p>Notice that these optional values are provided as <code>void*</code> pointers.
This is because a signal can either be <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, or <code>double</code>, and your maximum and minimum values should correspond in type and length.
So you should pass in a <code>int*</code>, <code>float*</code>, or <code>double*</code> by taking the address of a local variable.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is usually necessary to be informed when input signal values change.
This is done by providing a function to be called whenever its value is modified by an incoming message.
It is passed in the <code>handler</code> parameter, along with an <code>events</code> parameter specifying which types of events should trigger the handler.</p>

<p>An example of creating a &quot;barebones&quot; <code>int</code> scalar output signal with no unit, minimum, or maximum information and no callback handler:</p>

<pre>mpr_sig outA = mpr_sig_new(dev, MPR_DIR_OUT, &quot;outA&quot;,
                           1, MPR_INT32, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);</pre>

<p>An example of a <code>float</code> signal where some more information is provided:</p>

<pre>float min = 0.0f;
float max = 5.0f;
mpr_sig s1 = mpr_sig_new(dev, MPR_DIR_OUT, &quot;sensor1&quot;, 1, MPR_FLT,
                         &quot;V&quot;, &amp;min, &amp;max, 0, 0, 0);</pre>

<p>So far we know how to create a device and to specify an output signal for it.
To recap, let&#39;s review the code so far:</p>

<pre>mpr_dev dev = mpr_dev_new(&quot;my_device&quot;, 0, 0);
mpr_sig sig = mpr_sig_new(dev, MPR_DIR_OUT, &quot;sensor1&quot;, 1, MPR_FLT,
                          &quot;V&quot;, &amp;min, &amp;max, 0, 0, 0);

while (!done) {
    mpr_dev_poll(dev, 50);
    ... do stuff ...
    ... update signals ...
}

mpr_dev_free(dev);</pre>

<p>Note that although you have a pointer to the mpr_sig structure (which was returned by <code>mpr_sig_new()</code>), its memory is &quot;owned&quot; by the device.
In other words, you should not worry about freeing its memory - this
will happen automatically when the device is destroyed.
It is possible to retrieve a device&#39;s inputs or outputs by name or by index at a later time using the functions <code>mpr_dev_get_sigs()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Updating signals</h3>

<p>We can imagine the above program getting sensor information in a loop.
It could be running on an network-enable ARM device and reading the ADC register directly, or it could be running on a computer and reading data from an Arduino over a USB serial port, or it could just be a mouse-controlled GUI slider.
However it&#39;s getting the data, it must provide it to <em>libmapper</em> so that it will be sent to other devices if that signal is mapped.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by the function <code>mpr_sig_set_value()</code>:</p>

<pre>void mpr_sig_set_value(mpr_sig sig, mpr_id inst, int length,
                       mpr_type type, void *value);</pre>

<p>As you can see, a <code>void*</code> pointer must be provided, which must point to a data structure matching the <code>length</code> and <code>type</code> arguments.
This data structure is not required to match the length and type of the signal itself—libmapper will perform type coercion if necessary.</p>

<p>So in the &quot;sensor 1&quot; example, assuming in <code>do_stuff()</code> we have some code which reads sensor 1&#39;s value into a float variable called <code>v1</code>, the loop becomes:</p>

<pre>while (!done) {
    mpr_dev_poll(my_dev, 50);

    // call hypothetical user function that reads a sensor
    float v1 = do_stuff();
    mpr_sig_set_value(sig, 0, 1, MPR_FLT, &amp;v1);
}</pre>

<p>This is about all that is needed to expose sensor 1&#39;s value to the network as a mappable parameter.
The <em>libmapper</em> GUI can now map this value to a receiver, where it could control a synthesizer parameter or change the brightness of an
LED, or whatever else you want to do.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Signal conditioning</h3>

<p>Most synthesizers of course will not know what to do with the value of sensor1--it is an electrical property that has nothing to do with sound or music.
This is where <em>libmapper</em> really becomes useful.</p>

<p>Scaling or other signal conditioning can be taken care of <em>before</em> exposing the signal, or it can be performed as part of the mapping.
Since the end user can demand any mathematical operation be performed on the signal, they can perform whatever mappings between signals as they wish.</p>

<p>As a developer, it is therefore your job to provide information that will be useful to the end user.</p>

<p>For example, if sensor 1 is a position sensor, instead of publishing &quot;voltage&quot;, you could convert it to centimeters or meters based on the known dimensions of the sensor, and publish a &quot;sensor1/position&quot; signal instead, providing the unit information as well.</p>

<p>We call such signals &quot;semantic&quot;, because they provide information with more meaning than a relatively uninformative value based on the electrical properties of the sensing technique.
Some sensors can benefit from low-pass filtering or other measures to reduce noise.
Some sensors may need to be combined in order to derive physical meaning.
What you choose to expose as outputs of your device
is entirely application-dependent.</p>

<p>Best of all, you can publish both &quot;sensor1/position&quot; and &quot;sensor1/voltage&quot; if desired, in order to expose both processed and raw data.
Keep in mind that these will not take up significant processing time, and <em>zero</em> network bandwidth, if they are not mapped.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Receiving signals</h3>

<p>Now that we know how to create a sender, it would be useful to also know how to receive signals, so that we can create a sender-receiver pair to test out the provided mapping functionality.
The current value and timestamp for a signal can be retrieved at any time by calling <code>mpr_sig_get_value()</code>, however for event-driven applications you may want to be informed of new values as they are received or generated.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the <code>mpr_sig_new()</code> function takes an optional <code>handler</code> and <code>events</code>.
This is a function that will be called whenever the value of that signal changes or instances events occur.
To create a receiver for a synthesizer parameter &quot;pulse width&quot; (given as a ratio between 0 and 1), specify a handler when calling <code>mpr_sig_new()</code>.
We&#39;ll imagine there is some C++ synthesizer implemented as a class <code>Synth</code> which has functions <code>setPulseWidth()</code> which sets the pulse width in a thread-safe manner, and <code>startAudioInBackground()</code> which sets up the audio thread.</p>

<p>Create the handler function, which is fairly simple,</p>

<pre>void pw_handler (mpr_sig sig, mpr_int_evt evt, mpr_id inst, int length,
                 mpr_type type, void *value, mpr_time_t *time)
{
    if (!length || !value)
        return;
    Synth *s = (Synth*) mpr_obj_get_prop_as_ptr(sig, MPR_PROP_DATA, 0);
    s-&gt;setPulseWidth(*(float*)v);
}</pre>

<p>First, the pointer to the <code>Synth</code> instance is extracted from the <code>MPR_PROP_DATA</code> property, then it is dereferenced to set the pulse width according to the value pointed to by <code>v</code>.</p>

<p>Then <code>main()</code> will look like,</p>

<pre>void main()
{
    Synth synth;
    synth.startAudioInBackground();

    float min_pw = 0.0f;
    float max_pw = 1.0f;

    mpr_dev synth_dev = mpr_dev_new(&quot;synth&quot;, 0);

    mpr_sig pw = mpr_sig_new(synth_dev, MPR_DIR_IN, &quot;pulsewidth&quot;, 1, &#39;f&#39;, 0,
                             &amp;min_pw, &amp;max_pw, 0, pulsewidth_handler,
                             MPR_SIG_UPDATE);
    mpr_obj_set_prop(pw, MPR_PROP_DATA, 0, 1, MPR_PTR, &amp;synth, 0);

    while (!done)
        mpr_dev_poll(synth_dev, 50);

    mpr_dev_free(synth_dev);
}</pre>

<h2 id="toc_12">Working with timetags</h2>

<p><em>libmapper</em> uses the <code>mpr_time_t</code> data structure to store
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#NTP_timestamps">NTP timestamps</a>.
For example, the handler function called when a signal update is received contains a <code>timetag</code> argument.
This argument indicates the time at which the source signal was <em>sampled</em> (in the case of sensor signals) or <em>generated</em> (in the case of sequenced or algorithimically-generated signals).</p>

<p><em>libmapper</em> provides helper functions for getting the current device-time, setting the value of a <code>mpr_time</code> structure from other representations, and comparing or copying timetags.
Check the API documentation for more information.</p>

<h2 id="toc_13">Working with signal instances</h2>

<p><em>libmapper</em> also provides support for signals with multiple <em>instances</em>, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>control parameters for polyphonic synthesizers;</li>
<li>touches tracked by a multitouch surface;</li>
<li>&quot;blobs&quot; identified by computer vision systems;</li>
<li>objects on a tabletop tangible user interface;</li>
<li><em>temporal</em> objects such as gestures or trajectories.</li>
</ul>

<p>The important qualities of signal instances in <em>libmapper</em> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>instances are interchangeable</strong>: if there are semantics attached to a specific instance it should be represented with separate signals instead.</li>
<li><strong>instances can be ephemeral</strong>: signal instances can be dynamically created and destroyed.
<em>libmapper</em> will ensure that linked devices share a common understanding of the relatonships between instances when they are mapped.</li>
<li><strong>map once for all instances</strong>: one mapping connection serves to map all of its instances.</li>
</ul>

<p>All signals possess one instance by default.
If you would like to reserve more instances you can use:</p>

<pre>int mpr_sig_reserve_inst(mpr_sig sig, int num, mpr_id *ids, void **data);</pre>

<p>If the <code>ids</code> argument is null <em>libmapper</em> will automatically assign unique ids to the reserved instances.</p>

<p>After reserving instances you can update a specific instance using:</p>

<pre>void mpr_sig_set_value(mpr_sig signal, mpr_id instance, int length,
                       mpr_type type, const void *value);</pre>

<p>The <code>instance</code> argument does not have to be considered as an array index - it can be any value that is convenient for labelling your instance.
<em>libmapper</em> will internally create a map from your id label to one of the preallocated instance structures.</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">Receiving instances</h3>

<p>You might have noticed earlier that the handler function called when a signal update is received has a argument called <code>inst</code>.
Here is the function prototype again:</p>

<pre>void mpr_sig_handler(mpr_sig sig, mpr_inst_evt evt, mpr_id inst, int len,
                     mpr_type type, const void *value, mpr_time time);</pre>

<p>Under normal usage, this argument will have a value (0 &lt;= n &lt;= num_instances) and can be used as an array index.
Remember that you will need to reserve instances for your input signal using <code>mpr_sig_reserve_inst()</code> if you want to receive instance updates.</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">Instance Stealing</h3>

<p>For handling cases in which the sender signal has more instances than the receiver signal, the <em>instance allocation mode</em> can be set for an input signal to set an action to take in case all allocated instances are in use and a previously unseen instance id is received.
Use the function <code>mpr_obj_set_prop()</code>.</p>

<p>The argument <code>mode</code> can have one of the following values:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MPR_STEAL_NONE</code> Default value, in which no stealing of instances will occur;</li>
<li><code>MPR_STEAL_OLDEST</code> Release the oldest active instance and reallocate its resources to the new instance;</li>
<li><code>MPR_STEAL_NEWEST</code> Release the newest active instance and reallocate its resources to the new instance;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to use another method for determining which active instance to release (e.g. the sound with the lowest volume), you can create an handler for the signal and write the method yourself:</p>

<pre>void my_handler(mpr_sig sig, mpr_int_evt evt, mpr_id inst, int len,
                mpt_type type, const void *value, mpr_time time)
{
    // hypothetical user code chooses which instance to release
    mpr_id release_me = choose_instance_to_release(sig);

    mpr_sig_release_inst(sig, release_me);

    // now an instance is available
}</pre>

<p>For this function to be called when instance stealing is necessary, we need to register it for <code>MPR_SIG_INST_OFLW</code> events:</p>

<pre>mpr_sig_set_cb(sig, my_handler, MPR_SIG_INST_OFLW);</pre>

<h2 id="toc_16">Publishing metadata</h2>

<p>Things like device names, signal units, and ranges, are examples of metadata--information about the data you are exposing on the network.</p>

<p><em>libmapper</em> also provides the ability to specify arbitrary extra metadata in the form of name-value pairs.
These are not interpreted by <em>libmapper</em> in any way, but can be retrieved over the network.
This can be used for instance to give a device X and Y information, or to perhaps give a signal some property like &quot;reliability&quot;, or some category like &quot;light&quot;, &quot;motor&quot;, &quot;shaker&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>Some GUI could then use this information to display information about the network in an intelligent manner.</p>

<p>Any time there may be extra knowledge about a signal or device, it is a good idea to represent it by adding such properties, which can be of any OSC-compatible type.  (So, numbers and strings, etc.)</p>

<p>The property interface is through the functions,</p>

<pre>void mpr_obj_set_prop(mpr_obj obj, mpr_prop prop, const char *key,
                      int length, char type, void *value, int publish);

mpr_prop mpr_obj_get_prop_by_idx(mpr_obj obj, mpr_prop prop, const char **key,
                                 int *len, mpr_type *type, const void **val,
                                 int *pub);
mpr_prop mpr_obj_get_prop_by_key(mpr_obj obj, const char *key, int *len,
                                 mpr_type *type, const void **val, int *pub);</pre>

<p>The type of the <code>value</code> argument is specified by <code>type</code>: floats are <code>MPR_FLT</code>, 32-bit integers are <code>MPR_INT32</code>, doubles are <code>MPR_DBL</code>, and strings are MPR_STR.</p>

<p>For example, to store a <code>float</code> indicating the X position of a device, you can call it like this:</p>

<pre>float x = 12.5;
mpr_obj_set_prop(my_device, 0, &quot;x&quot;, 1, MPR_FLT, &amp;x, 1);

char *sensingMethod = &quot;resistive&quot;;
mpr_obj_set_prop(sensor1, 0, &quot;sensingMethod&quot;, 1, MPR_STR, sensingMethod);</pre>

<p>If the parent object (a device and a signal in this case) is <em>local</em> the property change takes place immediately.
If the object is <em>remote</em> the property change is only staged and must be pushed out to the network using the functions <code>mpr_obj_push()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>publish</code> argument is used to specify whether the object property should be pushed to the libmapper graph.
If set to 0, the property will only be accessible locally.</p>

<h3 id="toc_17">Reserved keys</h3>

<p>You can use any property name not already reserved by <em>libmapper</em>.</p>
